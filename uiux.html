                  Fitness App for Bachelor's Thesis
                  <div class="description" style="display: none">
                    This fitness app is specifically designed for my bachelor's
                    thesis. In the process, I created five relevant elements
                    (start screen, navigation bar, add workout function, workout
                    detail view, and calendar) based on a scientific approach.
                    The key frameworks applied were three of

                    To achieve this, I first analyzed five existing fitness
                    apps and evaluated them based on relevant literature. I then
                    combined this knowledge with design theory to create the
                    app. After designing, I conducted user tests to gather
                    feedback, which demonstrated that a scientific design
                    approach leads to an effective user experience.

                    I created this prototype in Figma to improve my auto-layout skills by
                    working on a real-world project. As a small challenge for
                    myself, I tried to present everything compactly on a
                    1920x1080 resolution. The prototype is fully interactive within
                    Figma and includes hover, press, and filter interactions.

                  Spotify Spatial Music Viewer
                  <div class="description" style="display: none">
                    In this project, I worked in a group to link Spotify data
                    with a spatial layer. We aimed to visualize the
                    most-streamed albums and songs in each available European
                    country. The goal was to create an interactive web map where
                    users can click on a country to see its specific trends. We
                    used the Spotify API to obtain the most up-to-date data.
                    With the help of Python, we implemented an automated process
                    for data retrieval over time. If the program was running on
                    a server, the trends would automatically update
                    continuously. You can read more about this project on my
